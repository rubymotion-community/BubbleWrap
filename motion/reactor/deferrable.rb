      # callback/errback. If the user has coded these with arguments,
      # then the user code will throw an argument exception. Implementors
      # of deferrable classes must document the arguments they will supply
      # to user callbacks.
      # OBSERVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL here: you may call this method even
      # on the INSIDE of a callback. This is very useful when a
      # previously-registered callback wants to change the parameters that
      # will be passed to subsequently-registered ones.
      # You may give either :succeeded or :failed as the status argument.
      # If you pass :succeeded, then all of the blocks passed to the object
      # using the callback method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the
      # set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks passed to the
      # object using errback will be discarded.
      # If you pass :failed, then all of the blocks passed to the object
      # using the errback method (if any) will be executed BEFORE the
      # set_deferred_status method returns. All of the blocks passed to the
      # object using # callback will be discarded.
      # If you pass any arguments to set_deferred_status in addition to the
      # status argument, they will be passed as arguments to any callbacks
      # or errbacks that are executed. It’s your responsibility to ensure
      # that the argument lists specified in your callbacks and errbacks match
      # the arguments given in calls to set_deferred_status, otherwise Ruby
